        <h3>Reviews</h3>
        <h4><i>Year round favorite place to hike.</i></h4>
        <blockquote>Wharton State Forest is New Jersey hiker's paradise. It offers numerous shorter and longer fairly well maintained trails, picturesque picnic and camping sites and hosts major parts of Batona Trail. We like coming back here and exploring various routes.</blockquote>

        <h4><i>Fantastic Hiking, good camping</i></h4>
        <blockquote>We camped at the Atsion Family Campground, our site gave access to the lake, which was great to put in our kayak. The are is fantastic, we did several hikes in the Pine Barrens forest, it was awesome. The only thing I did not like were the strict rules about the small area where swimming was allowed, and only from 11 AM until 8 PM.</blockquote>

        <h4><i>Dirty Camp Sites, Expensive Permits, and Strick Rangers</i></h4>
        <blockquote>I would not recommend anyone get a camping permit at Wharton State Forest. The camp sites have trash all over them, the permits can run over $30 a night, and the rangers patrol constantly and violate you privacy in regards to find ways to give you expensive infractions.</blockquote>
